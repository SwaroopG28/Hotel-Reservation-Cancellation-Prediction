# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation-Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of hotel reservation cancellations based on a variety of booking and customer features, such as reservation dates, booking method, customer demographics, and more. The model is designed to assist hotels in understanding potential cancellations in advance, allowing them to optimize room allocation, revenue management, and customer engagement strategies.

Using machine learning, the model identifies patterns that typically lead to cancellations, providing insights that can help improve hotel operations and enhance guest experience by addressing potential cancellation risks proactively.
